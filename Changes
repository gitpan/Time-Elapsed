Revision history for Perl extension Time::Elapsed.

Time zone is GMT+2.

0.14 Thu Apr 26 12:25:38 2007
   => Another release for failures. It looks like
      the cause is rounding error. I'm not sure
      about the cause, since the tests pass on other
      systems.

0.13 Wed Apr 25 20:47:27 2007
   => Another fix for tests.
   => Test::More is now required.

0.12 Tue Apr 24 18:15:25 2007
   => Fixed 01-pod.t for legacy perls. This test is now
      skipped if perl version is < 5.008.

0.11 Tue Apr 24 00:36:53 2007
   => Fixed Pod typos.

0.10 Mon Apr 23 22:01:22 2007
	=> First release.
